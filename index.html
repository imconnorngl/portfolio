                <span>The Statsify team are the creators of the largest and most
                  advanced Hypixel bot as well as Minecraft overlay.
                  This is a massive discord bot orientated around Minecraft
                  statistics for a server called Hypixel. This discord bot
                  services over 2M unique users across 40k guilds. As part of my
                  work with Statsify I was involved with almost every aspect of
                  the bot, including: the website, the custom API, the actual
                  bot and the overlay; mostly coded in JavaScript. You can check
                  out up to date stats about the bot

                  <span>Lunar Client is the largest Minecraft client. This is a
                    massive client which allows for quality of life
                    modifications ontop of the game. It is used by over 100k
                    concurrent users.
                    As part of my work with Lunar Client I was involved in
                    working with the team of web developers to design and create
                    their custom site including the backend and frontend
                    compontents coded in various languages and frameworks.

                    <span>As part of a fun challenge to feature on my YouTube
                      channel I decided to design a fullstack project which I
                      single-handedly designed. This project surpassed any
                      expectation that I had for the project growing over 20k
                      unique users and over 0.25M matches and conversations.
                      This project held up extremely well under the unexpected
                      load and showcases a huge amount of experience in full
                      stack development.

                      <br>
                      Competitive Bedwars is a huge community of people who seek
                      to make the Minecraft gamemode of Bedwars more
                      competitive. They group together in a discord to fight
                      against each other to increase their ranking and prove they
                      are the best. As part of my work for this community I
                      created a custom Discord bot to ensure they could queue
                      into their games. This bot also keeps track of their ELO and
                      statistics such as kills and deaths. It involves an advanced 
                      matchmaking system to queue users together in fair and balanced
                      fights. This project helped me learn a huge amount of
                      advanced strategies involved in matchmaking as well as
                      balanced ELO algorithms.

                      There are many other smaller commissions and experience
                       I have which I don't believe fits into it's own category. These are as follows:
                      <br><br>
                      ■ During my time making commissions for discord I have made a 
                      huge amount of ticket and support systems. Over this time I have
                      found a system for making ticket bots which is customisable and 
                      effective. Some examples of these bots can be seen throughout the gallery.
                      <br><br>
                      ■ Alongside making discord bots I have a huge passion for open sourcing
                      the solutions I provide when I am sure they are clean and flexible. 
                      This includes a custom bot template which is used by many other developers who
                      are learning and is a simple to modify template. This means that once I deliver 
                      a product to you it is extremely simple to configure and modify it how you
                       would like. You can check out the bot template <a href="https://github.com/imconnorngl/bot-template" target="_blank">here</a>.
